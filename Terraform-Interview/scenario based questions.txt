ðŸ”¹ Question 1: You have an existing infrastructure on AWS, and you need to use Terraform to manage it. How would you import these resources into your Terraform configuration?
ðŸ”¹ Question 2: You are working with multiple environments (e.g., dev, prod) and want to avoid duplicating code. How would you structure your Terraform configurations to achieve code reuse?
ðŸ”¹ Question 3: Describe a situation where you might need to use the terraform remote backend, and what advantages does it offer in state management?
ðŸ”¹ Question 4: You need to create a highly available architecture in AWS using Terraform. Explain how you would implement an Auto Scaling Group with load balancing.
ðŸ”¹ Question 5: Your team is adopting a multi-cloud strategy, and you need to manage resources on both AWS and Azure using Terraform. How would you structure your Terraform code to handle this?
ðŸ”¹ Question 6: You want to run specific scripts after provisioning resources with Terraform. How would you achieve this, and what provisioners might you use?
ðŸ”¹ Question 7: You are dealing with sensitive information, such as API keys, in your Terraform configuration. What approach would you take to manage these securely?
ðŸ”¹ Question 8: Describe a scenario where you might need to use Terraform workspaces, and how would you structure your project to take advantage of them?
ðŸ”¹ Question 9: You've made changes to your Terraform configuration, and now you want to preview the execution plan before applying the changes. How would you do this?
ðŸ”¹ Question 10: Your team has decided to adopt GitOps practices for managing infrastructure with Terraform. How would you integrate Terraform with version control systems like Git?
ðŸ”¹ Question 11: You need to manage infrastructure secrets, such as database passwords, in your Terraform configuration. What method or provider might you use?
ðŸ”¹ Question 12: Your team wants to ensure that the infrastructure is consistently provisioned across multiple environments. How would you implement a consistent environment configuration?
ðŸ”¹ Question 13: You are tasked with migrating your existing infrastructure from Terraform v0.11 to v0.12. What considerations and steps would you take?
ðŸ”¹ Question 14: Explain a situation where you might need to use terraform taint and what effect it has on resources.
ðŸ”¹ Question 15: Your team is adopting GitLab CI/CD for automating Terraform workflows. Describe how you would structure your CI/CD pipeline for Terraform, including key stages.
